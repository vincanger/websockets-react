You can also check out the [Wasp version of this app](https://github.com/vincanger/websockets-wasp), which makes building with WebSockets **even easier**, as Wasp takes care of most of the boilerplate associated with building a full-stack React/NodeJS app.

## Running the app

Install the server dependencies
```bash
cd ws-server 
```

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/cors
```

Run the server
```bash 
npm run start
```

Install the client dependencies
